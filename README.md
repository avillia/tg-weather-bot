# avillia-weather-bot
Small telegram bot to get weather forecasts.

## How to setup?
Prodvide your tokens and creds in `configs.ini`, and then run `bot.py`.

## Why it doesn't work on my desktop???
Ah, and yes, there is no desktop version support, because of using geolocation. And it will probably __never__ come. Only mobile.
